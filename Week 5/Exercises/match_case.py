# The match-case construct (introduced in Python 3.10) is Pythonâ€™s version of a pattern matching mechanism. It provides a powerful and expressive way to handle complex conditional logic, often replacing cumbersome if-elif chains.
# Before match-case, handling multiple conditions (especially for structured data) required lengthy if-elif chains, which were less readable and harder to maintain.
# Python lacked a direct equivalent of a switch-case statement, which is common in other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript.

# Replacing Long if-elif Chains:
# Before:

command = "start"
if command == "start":
    print("Starting...")
elif command == "stop":
    print("Stopping...")
elif command == "pause":
    print("Pausing...")
else:
    print("Unknown command")

# After:

match command:
    case "start":
        print("Starting...")
    case "stop":
        print("Stopping...")
    case "pause":
        print("Pausing...")
    case _:                            
        print("Unknown command")  # Default case (like 'else')

# Example:

def http_status(status):
    match status:
        case 200:
            return "OK"
        case 404:
            return "Not Found"
        case 500:
            return "Internal Server Error"
        case _:
            return "Unknown Status"  # Default case (like 'else')
        
print(http_status(500))
